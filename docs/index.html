            <p class="paragraph">Types of fruit juice include orange juice, cranberry juice, apple juice, and more. Fruit juice benefits can depend on the type of juice. Some risks are also associated with drinking large amounts of certain juices.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Fruit juice comes from the flesh of the fruit or from the whole fruit itself. The method of making fruit juice varies depending on the fruit, but many manufacturers make juice by crushing or “pressing” the fruit to squeeze out the juice inside, then pasteurizing or adding preservatives before packaging the final product.</p>   
            <p class="paragraph">Though many fruit juices have health benefits, consuming too much fruit juice can cause health complications for people, such as weight gain or changes to blood sugar levels.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with concentrate or other biological food sources, such as meat or seafood, such as clam juice. Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, such as smoothies. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods enabled its preservation without using fermentation (which is used in wine production). The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increases with a country's income level.</p>

        <div class="container">
           <p class="paragraph">Manufacturers often describe fruit juices as “from concentrate” and “not from concentrate”. This refers to the manufacturing process.</p>
           <p class="paragraph">Producers make juice that is “not from concentrate” by juicing the fruit before pasteurizing it. Pasteurizing involves heating the juice to kill pathogens. Manufacturers then package the juice and sell it.</p>
           <p><img class="col-img" src="images/image (13).png"></p>
           <p class="paragraph">Juice that manufacturers describe as “from concentrate” has one extra step in its manufacturing process. Firstly, the producers juice the fruit. They then filter it in a process that extracts the water from the juice. This means the juice takes up less space during transportation.</p>
           <p class="paragraph">Before pasteurizing, makers add water back to the juice concentrate. After pasteurizing, manufacturers then package the juice for sale.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Eating the daily recommended amount of fruits and vegetables can help people reduce their riskTrusted Source of many leading causes of illness and death. These include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and obesity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, the daily recommended amount of fruit is:</p>
           <p class="paragraph">Adult females: At least 1 and a half cups of fruit per day.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) states that at least half of the daily recommended amount of fruit should come from whole fruit. This means that a person should not get their daily recommended allowance from fruit juice alone.</p>
